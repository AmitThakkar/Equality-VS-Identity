What is difference between Equality (==) and Identity (===) ? \r\n2. Is there a performance benefit with Equality (==) or Identity (===) ? \r\n\r\nAnswers: \r\n\r\n1. What is Difference Between Equality (==) And Identity (===) ? Equality (==) returns true if both value/operands \r\n    have the same value, without worrying about type of both value/operands. \r\n    e.g.\r\n    ```JavaScript\r\n    2 == 1 // returns false, both value/operands have different value.\r\n    2 == 2 // returns true, both value/operands have same type and value\r\n    2 == \"2\" // returns true, while both value/operands have different type, first value is type of number and second one is type of string, but value is same.\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Equality (==) first compares types, if types are not same, then first convert both values/operands to same type, \r\n    then compare both value/operands, while on other hand Identity (===) first compares types, if types are same then \r\n    it only compares the value of both the operands, otherwise returns false.\r\n    e.g.\r\n    ```JavaScript\r\n    2 === 1 // returns false, both value/operands have different value.\r\n    2 === 2 // returns true, both value/operands have same type and value\r\n    2 === \"2\" // returns false, both value/operands have same value but different types, first value is type of number and second one is string.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Is there a performance benefit with Equality (==) or Identity (===) ? \r\n    Identity (===) does not do type conversion (if types are not same it returns false), So Identity (===) is faster than Equality (==).\r\n    \r\n    > Identity (===), is generally better and safer, because there is no behind the scenes type conversion.\r\n\r\nFollow Me\r\n---\r\n[Github](https://github.com/AmitThakkar)\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/amit_thakkar01)\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/amitthakkar01)\r\n\r\n[More Blogs By Me](http://amitthakkar.github.io/)",
